# About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my very first website which is all about bugs I have photographed with my macro lens over the years.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, HTML5 and CSS.
- ðŸª• My hobbies include: playing the banjo, knitting socks, hiking, swimming, drawing and (of course) board games.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am an amateur storyteller and write and perform my own fairytales.
